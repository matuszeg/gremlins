//     mutated package does not consume it. This is the leash that matters: it is
//     what stops a mutant that never terminates.
//   - The context deadline (run bound + compile allowance) bounds compilation
//     and the run together. No -timeout can bound a compile that hangs, because
//     no test binary exists yet to enforce it, so the context stays as the
//     backstop. It is also rooted in the engine's runCtx, so an external
//     cancellation (e.g. SIGTERM from a CI runner) propagates into the child and
//     we can tell "the runner is shutting us down" from "this mutant ran long".
//
// Classification cannot go on the exit status alone. `go test` reports a test
// timeout, a build failure and an ordinary test failure all as exit status 1 —
// only the test BINARY exits 2, and what we spawn is `go`. Taking that 1 at face
// value would record a timed-out mutant as KILLED, crediting a detection that
// never happened, and a mutant that does not compile as KILLED too. So the
// child's output is scanned for the markers that tell the three apart.
//
// The two bounds also produce two DIFFERENT timeout verdicts, and the ordering
// below is what keeps them apart. mutator.RunTimedOut is the only branch here
// backed by a positive observation: the test binary printed, in its own output,
// that the suite it was running overran the leash `go test -timeout` gave it.
// Every other branch infers from an absence — a deadline that expired, a context
// that was cancelled, an exit status that says nothing about which phase
// produced it. mutator.TimedOut is that absence, and it must stay separate

// about, which is the one direction a mutation tool must never shrink in. What
