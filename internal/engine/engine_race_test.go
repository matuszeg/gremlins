// TestRunDoesNotReadATokenAWorkerIsMutating runs the engine over one token
// with two mutants, with an executor that applies its mutant as soon as it
// gets it, as the legacy executor does. The two mutants share the token's AST
// node, so once the walk has handed out the first of them it must not read
// the node again: a worker may be rewriting it.
//
// The viability check of the second mutant holds the walk until the first
// mutant has been applied, without ordering the two goroutines before that,
// so that -race reports a read the walk makes of the node after handing out
// the first mutant. It is evidence only under -race.
