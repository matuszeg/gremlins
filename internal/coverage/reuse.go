// reusable decides which of a cached package's mappings survive the change that
// moved its build ID, and returns them in the current line numbering — or,
// when none can be kept, why not, which the caller logs: a whole-package
// re-map is the expensive outcome, and the reason is what says whether it was
// necessary.
//
// # The rule
//
// A package and every dependency it instruments are read as entities (see
// pkgPrint): each function, method, type spec, var spec and const group, and
// each file's import table. Comparing two prints, a change is one of three
// things.
//
//   - A function body. A test that did not execute the changed body cannot
//     behave differently on its account: any change that redirected its path
//     would itself have to be a change to a line it executed. The profile
//     records the package's lines a test executed and Deps the dependency
//     entities, so the tests whose record touches the body are dirty and no
//     others.
//   - A changed name: an entity added or removed, a type, var or const group
//     whose print changed, a function whose signature changed, a method added,
//     removed or re-signed (which changes its receiver type, and so the
//     interfaces it satisfies), and every name an import of the file now binds
//     differently. What follows from it is the closure below.
//   - Anything else, which re-maps the whole package, and every package that
//     has the changed one in scope (see the end of this comment).
//
// The closure starts from the changed names and adds every entity whose header
// mentions one, to a fixpoint. A header is what a name's meaning reaches
// through without being executed: a type spec, a var spec, a const group, a
// function's signature — and all of a test-file entity, because test files are
// never instrumented, so a helper's body is never in any record either. A test
// is then dirty when it executed — in its profile or its Deps — a body that
// changed or an entity whose text mentions an affected name, when its own
// declaration changed or mentions one, or when it reaches a test-file entity
// that does (which the closure has already made an affected name).
//
// # Why that is enough
//
// A test is affected by a change it did not execute only if it reaches the
// changed thing by name, or the change is to what runs before any test does.
// The routes by name are few: a value of a type built somewhere, a constant
// read, a function passed as a value — as huma.Register takes a handler and
// reflects over its signature — a type nested in another, an interface a type
// now satisfies. Each of those mentions the name somewhere a test's record
// sees: in code it executed (the profile or Deps), in a header the closure
// follows (a type nested in a type, a function returning one), or in the
// test's own source. A method added, removed or re-signed is a change to its
// receiver type, not to its own name: a call reaches the method only through
// a value of the type, and every such value is made by code that names it — a
// literal, a conversion, a declaration, a signature or field of a type that
// names it, reflection over another such value — which the test executed, or
// mentions, or the closure follows. Matching the method's own name as well
// would dirty every test calling any method so spelled — t.Fatalf, for a
// test type that gains a Fatalf. A method declared through an alias belongs
// to the type the alias names, which code can name without naming the alias,
// so a local type's alias carries the type's name as well as its own. An
// added name is a changed name because it can rebind an existing mention — a
// new package-level `min` captures every `min(x, 10)` in the package without
// a byte of them changing — and it is the mention that is followed, so that
// case needs nothing of its own. Reflection inside a package that is not
// instrumented only ever sees types that instrumented code named.
//
// What runs before any test is the initialisation of every linked package,
// and it reaches every test without a name. Four things decide it, and each
// is held somewhere a change to it re-maps the package. What runs: an init or
// a var initialised by a call is an entity that re-maps on any change, and so
// is a var whose initialiser formats a value — fmt.Errorf calls an operand's
// String or Error method there and then, so it is allowed as a plain entity
// only over literals and errors errors.New made. Which packages are linked:
// every linked import path is in Inputs, the standard library's included,
// because a package newly linked — crypto/md5 registering MD5 with crypto —
// changes what untouched code does. In what order within a package: a
// package's variables are initialised in declaration order, except that each
// waits for every variable its initialiser depends on — found through the
// bodies of the functions it calls, transitively, executed or not — so
// swapping two lines that print the same, or a body no test runs newly naming
// a variable, reorders it. That order is taken from the type-checker
// (types.Info.InitOrder, see typeFacts), and two variables both prints
// initialise trading places re-maps the package, as does a package the
// type-checker could not read. And in what order across packages: Go
// initialises, each time, the first package by import path whose imports are
// all done, so the order is a function of the packages linked and of the set
// each one reaches by import, directly or not (see importClosure) — an import
// added that the package already reached moves nothing. The linked set is in
// Inputs; each instrumented package's reach is listed by go/packages beside
// its type-check (pkgPrint.Reach); and a package's reach is its own imports
// and theirs, where the imports of a package outside the main modules are in
// its source, which is in Inputs — so when Inputs and every instrumented
// package's reach agree, no package's reach moved. When some
// instrumented package's reach changed and anything instrumented observes the
// order, the package is re-mapped. That rule and the order within a package
// hold different facts, and neither subsumes the other — a plain var reading
// a package whose init is not instrumented is seen by the first alone.
//
// The rule behind all of it: a fact the compiler derives is asked of the
// compiler. Every hole the closure has had was one — an init order worked out
// through function bodies, a dependency only a tagged file links — read off
// the syntax, or not read at all, and adding patterns for them one at a time
// is a race against the language. A print holds what the source says; what
// the toolchain works out from it comes from the toolchain, under the same
// build tags the test binary is compiled with, or the package is re-mapped.
//
// Matching is by name and deliberately over-approximate. Within one package
// directory — the package, its test files and its external test package — any
// identifier matches. Across packages only an exported name can be referred
// to, and it matches any identifier of that spelling, whatever the import
// alias; a dependency's unexported change reaches the rest of the binary only
// through its own exported entities, which the closure follows. Shadowing, a
// field or local of the same spelling, an unrelated package: each can only add
// dirty tests.
//
// # What still re-maps the whole package
//
// Everything the closure has no name to follow, wherever in the binary's
// in-scope packages it happens:
//
//   - a package, or an instrumented dependency, the type-checker or the
//     import listing could not read, before or after, and two variables
//     trading places in the order a package initialises them;
//   - a change to what the binary is built from that no profile records: a
//     dependency outside every main module, a main module's go.mod, the set of
//     packages linked, the toolchain, the build environment, the compile flags
//     (Inputs), or the set of instrumented dependencies itself;
//   - the set of packages an instrumented package reaches by import
//     changing, while anything instrumented observes the order of
//     initialisation: an init, or a var initialised by a call or by reading
//     another package — not TestMain, which runs after all of it (see
//     closure.observer);
//   - an init added, removed, changed, or mentioning an affected name; a var
//     whose initialiser calls something at initialisation, on the same terms;
//     TestMain on the same terms: each runs for every test;
//   - anything in Whole: a non-Go file or data below the directory (an
//     embedded file among them), a build constraint, a file named for a
//     platform, a blank or dot import, a cgo file, a directive outside every
//     declaration, a file that does not parse;
//   - a declaration with no name to pair it by — a blank var, a key two
//     declarations share — changing, and one carrying //go:linkname;
//   - a kept block that falls in no unchanged entity, which means the profile
//     and the print disagree about the package.
//
// A test file is not in that list. Its name decides only that it is compiled
// into the test binary alone, and its declarations, keyed by file, carry
// everything that follows from adding, removing or renaming one: a new test
// is mapped because it is new, a helper is followed by name, and a package it
// newly links is in Inputs.
//
// All of it fails in the safe direction: too many tests re-mapped, never too
// few. A mapping wrongly kept would mean a test that could kill a mutant is
// not run, so the mutant reports LIVED — a red result nobody can reproduce,
// which is why every case that is not clearly sound resolves to re-mapping.
//
// # What it cannot see
//
// A test's behaviour can hang on something no print holds, and then a kept
// mapping can be wrong. Each of these is a known exposure: a file read at run
// time from outside the package directory; a file of the package's own source
// read at run time — a test that parses its package's .go files, or embeds
// them, sees a change to any of them, where the closure sees only the
// entities that change names; an absolute source position read at run time —
// runtime.Caller, a stack trace, a panic message compared against — which
// moves when anything above it in the file does, while a moved entity whose
// print is unchanged keeps its mappings (TestDifferentialKnownExposures holds
// one); an initialiser outside the main modules in a package that imports
// one inside, which only a module cycle allows, seeing the order packages are
// initialised in; a binary built and run by a test; lines executed in a subprocess; and
// a nondeterministic path that reuse freezes as whichever way it went when the
// mapping was made. All but the positions are shared with reusing a map by
// build ID alone.
//
// It is deliberately not a call graph. The alternative — SSA plus
// reachability from each test root — is a much larger build, and it is
// defeated by reflection exactly where a package is most likely to use it.
//
// When nothing at all changed — every print and Inputs agree — every mapping
// is kept. The build ID still moved, because Go folds the checkout path into
// it, and the path decides nothing a test executes; that is the case of a
// cache restored into another runner's work directory. The mappings are still
// moved rather than kept as they are, because blank lines between

// A kept profile records where its blocks were, and the declarations around
// them may have grown or shrunk since; leaving the old numbers in place would
// answer about the wrong lines. Every block of a kept profile is inside a
// declaration whose content is unchanged — a block anywhere else would have
// made the test dirty — so each one moves by exactly the distance its
// declaration moved.
//
// A block that lands in no unchanged declaration is not guessed at: it means
// the profile and the fingerprint disagree about the package, and the answer is
// to re-map it. Where that block was is returned, and is empty when there is
// none.
