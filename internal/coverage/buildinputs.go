// buildInputsOf hashes everything the package's test binary is built from
// except the package itself and the dependencies it instruments: the source of
// every other dependency somebody could edit, the module's requirements, the
// toolchain, the build environment, and the flags Gremlins compiles the binary
// with.
//
// Per-test invalidation needs this, and the build ID cannot supply it. The
// build ID folds the package's own source together with every dependency's, so
// a moved build ID says something changed and never says where. That
// distinction is the whole of the difference between sound and nearly sound: a
// changed dependency can send a test down a path it did not take before, and if
// no profile records that dependency's lines the change looks clean to every
// mapping the cache holds. Narrowing on the package's own fingerprint while
// such a dependency also moved would keep mappings that are stale, and a stale
// mapping means a test that could kill a mutant is never selected — the mutant
// reports LIVED and the gate goes red on something nobody can reproduce.
//
// So a run narrows only while this is unchanged, and re-maps the whole package
// the moment it is not.
//
// An instrumented dependency is the exception, and the only one: its lines ARE
// recorded, per test, as the functions each test executed there, and it is
// fingerprinted beside the package (see fingerprint.Deps), so what changed in
// it can be attributed just as a change in the package can. Leaving it out of
// here is sound only because every directory it leaves out is one of those —
// both read the same listing and the same instrumented flag, and a dependency
// that cannot be fingerprinted fails the whole fingerprint rather than falling
// through the gap between the two.
//
// It has to be complete as well as cheap, because it is also what lets an
// unchanged package skip the build ID: with the fingerprint and this both equal,
// a moved build ID is taken to mean nothing but a moved checkout (see
// reusable). Anything that changes the compiled binary and is in neither would
// then be reused across, which is why the build environment and the compile
// flags are here although no source file holds them.
//
// It also has to name nothing that differs between two checkouts of the same
// module, or no cache restored on another machine could ever be used. A
// dependency is named by its path relative to the module root, or by its import
// path when it lives outside the root — a replace target or a go.work member,
// which can sit anywhere on disk. GOWORK, which is a path, is folded in the same
// way: relative to the module root.
//
// Directories are read rather than build IDs asked for: a dependency's identity
// according to Go means building it, and this has to be cheap enough to run
// before deciding whether there is work to skip. Measured at ~330ms for a
// package with 430 transitive dependencies, twelve of them in the module.
//
// What is left out is left out because something else in the hash pins it.
// GOROOT is pinned by the toolchain version. The module cache is pinned by
// go.sum and go.work.sum, whose contents are here — and a dependency vendored or
// replaced into a local directory is not in the module cache, so it is read like
// any other source.
