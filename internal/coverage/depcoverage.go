// test executed in a dependency never reaches TestsFor, Union or the coverage
// merge — but to be narrowed across. Before, a dependency's lines were in no
// profile, so any change to one re-mapped every package that linked it; now a
// test records which of a dependency's entities it executed, so a changed body
// there dirties exactly the tests that did, and a changed name whatever reaches
// it by name (see reusable).

// asks "did this test reach the entity that changed", and keys are all that
