// fingerprint is what a package's source looked like when its map was made.
//
// It exists because the build ID is too coarse to invalidate a map with. Every
// test of a package shares one test binary, so one changed line moves the build
// ID and dirties all of the package's mappings — and the package under mutation
// is by definition the package that was changed, so that is the case that
// always happens rather than the rare one.
//
// It is the package's own print (see pkgPrint) — every entity of the package
// and its test files, and the remainder hashed whole — plus one print per
// instrumented dependency, and Inputs for everything else the binary is built
// from. reusable reads two of them to decide which mappings a change reached.

	// Inputs is everything the test binary is built from except this package
	// and the dependencies in Deps: see buildInputsOf, which fills it in.
	// Without it a moved build ID could never be told apart from a moved
	// dependency, and narrowing would keep stale mappings. With it, a moved
	// build ID under an unchanged fingerprint (Deps included) and unchanged
	// Inputs is a moved checkout, and the whole map is kept.
	//
	// It is not read off the filesystem like the rest, so fingerprintOf leaves
	// it empty and the caller sets it — which is also what makes a fingerprint
	// with no inputs unusable rather than optimistic.

	// Deps is every dependency the test binary instruments besides this
	// package, by import path: the packages of every main module it links (see
	// dependencyDirs). Their lines are recorded per test, as the entities it
	// executed there, so a dependency is printed like the package rather than
	// hashed into Inputs — which is what lets a change in one dirty only the
	// tests it can reach. A dependency's test files are not part of its print:
