// cacheVersion is the shape of a cache file. A file written by a different
// version is discarded rather than migrated: it costs one rebuild, and the
// alternative is reading a map whose meaning has changed.
//
// Version 10 names a method by its receiver type alone.
// Version 9 records what each print's package reaches by import, which is
// what moves the order packages are initialised in, in place of comparing
// each file's imports; and prints TestMain as its own kind, which does not
// count as seeing that order.
// Version 8 carries each print's initialisation order as the type-checker
// derives it, and refuses to narrow from a print it could not derive it for.
// Version 7 folds every linked package and every main module's go.mod into
// Inputs, records which vars read another package at initialisation, names a
// local type's aliases among its names, lets fmt.Errorf through only over
// operands with no method of the package's, and reads a test file by its
// entities rather than its name.
// Version 6 prints every top-level entity of a package and its instrumented
// dependencies on its own — functions, methods, type and var specs, const
// groups, each file's import table — in place of one all-or-nothing shell, and
// follows a changed name through the headers that mention it (see reusable).
// Version 5 instruments a package's in-module dependencies alongside it: each
// test records the dependency functions it executed, the fingerprint carries
// each dependency's print, and Inputs no longer hashes those directories.
// Version 4 is shared between checkouts: its directory is named from the
// module alone, its Inputs name nothing by absolute path and fold in the build
// environment and compile flags, and an entry whose fingerprint and Inputs both
// agree is reused whole across a moved build ID. Version 3 records the
// package's source fingerprint beside its mappings, so that a changed package
// can keep the mappings the change could not have touched. Version 2 was one
// file per package. Version 1 was one file per module, which meant a run had
// to write back every package it had not looked at or lose them — and a
// scoped run, which is the recommended workflow, looks at one.

// cachedPackage is one package's mapping, and the build ID of the test binary
// it was produced from.
//
// The build ID is the key, and Go computes it over the package's own source AND
// every dependency's, transitively. So an unchanged build ID means nothing the
// package's tests execute has changed, and the coverage they produced cannot
// have changed either. Touching a package three levels down invalidates exactly
// the binaries that link it, without Gremlins doing any dependency analysis of
// its own.
//
// What the build ID cannot see is state outside the build: a test whose
// coverage depends on a database, a clock, or the network can map differently
// on two runs of the same binary. That is the same non-determinism the map has
// without a cache, held for longer.
//
// The build ID being coarse is why Fingerprint is here as well: it records what
// the package's source looked like when the mappings were made, so that a run
// whose build ID has moved can still ask which of them the change reached. An
// entry may have none — a package whose directory could not be read — in which
// case a changed build ID re-maps the whole package, as it always did.
//
// Deps is, per test, the dependency entities it executed (see
// splitCoverage). It is apart from Tests on purpose: Tests is coverage, and
// read as coverage everywhere, while Deps is only ever asked "did this test
// reach an entity that changed". A test that reached none has no entry.
//
// ImportPath is stored as well as hashed into the file name, so that a file
// found under the wrong name is a miss rather than another package's answer.
